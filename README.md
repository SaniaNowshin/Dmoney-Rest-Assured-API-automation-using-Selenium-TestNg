# Dmoney Portal Automation 

This repository consists of **API Automation** using **Rest Assured**, **Selenium**, **TestNG**, and **Java**.  
The automation framework follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for better maintainability and scalability.

Website: https://dmoneyportal.roadtocareer.net

I have automated the **user creation** process for **Customer**, **Agent** and **Merchant** roles. Additionally, several **transaction-related operations** have been automated, such as:
- Send Money  
- Agent to Customer Deposit  
- Money Withdrawal  
- Customer Payment  

Comprehensive **assertions** and **negative test cases** have been implemented for each scenario to ensure robust validation.

Manual and automated API testing has also been performed using **Postman**, and all test results are visualized using **Allure Reports**.
